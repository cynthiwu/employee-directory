## About The Project

The goal of this project was to build a simple Employee Directory application using React. The focus was on breaking up the application's UI into components and practice managing component state and responding to user events.

### Built With

This project was built using:

* JavaScript
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)
* [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
* [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/)

## Installation

While not necessary to run the program via the live link above, you may get a local copy up and running by following these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com:cynthiwu/employee-directory.git 
```

2. Install NPM packages (i.e., Inquirer)
```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

This project can be used as a demonstration of React components and a framework for manipulating UI based on user action. In addition, it is a good example of the Random User API and how the data can be used. Randomly generated data can be swapped out for user entered data.
